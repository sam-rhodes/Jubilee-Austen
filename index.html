            <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
            <div class="half-width">
              <p>My home base is in Tacoma, Washington, about 40 minutes south of Starbucks' hometown. My journey into tech started when I was quarantined during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. I made the jump to coding after I realized what I was doing for work became considered "non-essential" and I found myself furloughed and struggling to receive unemployment benefits. This was my blessing in disguise: I wanted to change career paths, and it was now or never!</p>

            <div class="half-width">
              <p>I've always had a passion to create, whatever it may be, and that's what I'm able to do today: create through the expression of HTML &amp; CSS. Once I created my first website, I became hooked; what else could I create? Who can I help? My ultimate goal was to have the freedom &amp; ability to travel, collaborate, and design with others for work. I now serve coffee during the day, and code at night. When I'm not working on a project, you can find me either at the gym or playing video games.</P>

              <h3>Jubilee Austen</h3>
              <p>This was my very first website created from scratch! This guy taught me all about instant gratification; everytime I saved my code and hit refresh in the browser, I would see more and more of this website coming to life. That's when I knew I loved writing code.</p>

              <h3>Rogue Pickings</h3>
              <p>My second go around with learning how to extract images, fonts, colors, and layout information from a .PSD design composition. Here I became confident in the basics, and adding little details (such as borders) became fun and satisfying to wrap up the project.</p>

              <h3>Recipe Collection</h3>
              <p>This is my most recent website that I've put together from a .PSD design composition. I experimented much more with the float command, margins, and creating columns inside classes inside id's! This project was a little bit more complex and very rewarding.</p>
